# Systems Portfolio 

In GitHub, the `dewv` organization has a "project board" for managing the systems portfolio. 

An organization's systems portfolio is a central information source about all of its systems and system projects.

The [Systems Portfolio project board](https://github.com/orgs/dewv/projects/3) has five columns or "lists".

The leftmost column, "Suggestion", is a place to capture ideas for systems that might be pursued someday.

The other four columns take their names from a project management process build around the spiral model and anchor point milestones. As a systems project receives resources, it will move to the right on the portfolio board, until the effort is abandoned or the system goes into production.
