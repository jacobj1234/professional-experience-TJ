# Project Management

When a systems project is moved from the "Suggestion" column of the [Systems Portfolio board](https://github.com/orgs/dewv/projects/3) to the "Inception" column, make a copy of The `project-management-template` [repo](https://github.com/dewv/project-management-template) for the new project.  

A project's management repo is not for the code and other "deliverables" of the project; it is to track the completion of project management tasks.

The `README` file(s) and Issues in the project management repo guide the project manager through these tasks.
