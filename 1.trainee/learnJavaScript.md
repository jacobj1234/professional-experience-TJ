# Learn JavaScript

In the introductory courses, you learned to write games with JavaScript running in a Web browser. But your JavaScript code manipulated game-related objects provided by custom game engines. Your code did not deal directly with HTML page contents and other browser details.

*Some* of the JavaScript code written for DevOps runs in the Web browser and manipulates HTML page contents (especially forms). 

1. To prepare, study the following tutorial pages at w3schools.com.

- [ ] [JavaScript `let`](). This page explains the difference between `let` and `var`. The w3schools tutorials use `var` because it has always been a part of JavaScript, and `let` is fairly new. But best practice is to restrict variable scope as much as possible, so you should use `let` unless situations force you to do different.

- [ ] [JavaScript Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp). This page shows you how to write "bare" functions that are not defined inside a class. Your intro courses emphasized object-oriented JavaScript. In general, the JS functions that you wrote were methods inside of classes, and they manipulated the `this` object. For simple manipulations of HTML pages, we can often write "bare" functions without any custom classes or objects. 

- [ ] [JavaScript Where To](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp). This page explains how JavaScript code is combined into an HTML Web page. In the intro classes, you were generally given HTML files that loaded external JS scripts with prearranged filenames. That will often be true for DevOps work, too.

- [ ] [JavaScript Form Validation](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp). This page shows you how to write JavaScript functions that validate data entered through a form on an HTML page.

2. Take the [JavaScript quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?Qtest=JavaScript) until you score 90% or higher, with a time limit of one minute per question. (You may need to review some other tutorials at w3schools.) Take a screenshot that shows your score and Time Spent, and add the image to this page.

3. Add the "JavaScript" skill to your LinkedIn profile. Your supervisor will endorse it.
