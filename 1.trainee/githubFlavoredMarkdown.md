# GitHub-Flavored Markdown

Markdown is a syntax for formatting plain text files that is easy for humans to write and read. It is also easy for machines to process in a variety of ways.

Because it is plain ("ASCII") text, it can be written and read (in raw form) using any programmer's text editor, any Web browser, and many other simple tools. No fancy software is needed.

Because it contains formatting, various software tools can "render" the text in sophisticated ways. In this sense it is much like Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, except that it is easy for humans to write and to read in its raw (unrendered) form.

Like many tools used by computing professionals, GitHub includes features for working with markdown. GitHub adds some extra syntax options, described as "GitHub-flavored" to "standard" Markdown. 

[Read about the basics](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) of using Markdown in GitHub. Pay special attention to the section on check lists. As much as possible, we will use Markdown documents instead of Word, PDF, etc. 

For example, this file and most other English documents that you find in GH repos is Markdown stored in a file with the `.md` extension. If you like, you can experiment by editing this file online at GitHub. 

For longer documents, it is sometimes nice to have a WYSIWYG interface more like a traditional word processor. Many tools, including our programming environment, allow you to put a text editor side-by-side with a preview pane that renders Markdown.

Even better is the native application [Typora](http://typora.io/). It provides a true single-pane WYSIWYG interface on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is free at the time of this writing.

Now that you have completed this activity, mark the checklist item in this folder's [`README.md`](./README.md). That will require you to use a bit of Markdown, which is why this activity comes first.
