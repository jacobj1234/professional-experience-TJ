## About FERPA

[What is FERPA?](http://familypolicy.ed.gov/content/what-ferpa)      

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that affords parents the right to have access to their children’s education records, the right to seek to have the records amended, and the right to have some **control over the disclosure** of personally identifiable information from the education records.  When a student turns 18 years old, or enters a postsecondary institution at any age, the rights under FERPA transfer from the parents to the student (“eligible student”). The FERPA statute is found at 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and the FERPA regulations are found at 34 CFR Part 99.

[What is an Education Record?](http://familypolicy.ed.gov/content/what-education-record)      

Education records are records that are directly related to a student and that are maintained by an educational agency or institution or a party acting for or on behalf of the agency or institution.  These records include but are not limited to grades, transcripts, class lists, student course schedules, health records (at the K-12 level), student financial information (at the postsecondary level), and student discipline files.  The information may be recorded in any way, including, but not limited to, handwriting, print, computer media, videotape, audiotape, film, microfilm, microfiche, and e-mail.

## FERPA Agreement

I understand that by the virtue of my work in CSCI 290 and/or CSCI 390 at Davis and Elkins College, I may have access to records or information which contains individually identifiable information, the disclosure of which is prohibited by the **Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974**. I acknowledge that I fully understand that intentional disclosure by me of this information to any unauthorized person could subject me to criminal and civil penalties imposed by law. I further acknowledge that such willful or unauthorized disclosure also violates Davis and Elkins College policy and could constitute just cause for disciplinary action including but not limited to failing the course, regardless of whether criminal or civil penalties are imposed.
