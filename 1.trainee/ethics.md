1. Read the [Pledge of the Computing Professional](http://pledge-of-the-computing-professional.org/home-page/the-oath).
2. Be aware that the Association for Computing Machinery promotes a more detailed [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct) that is widely used and respected.
3. Understand that you are expected to behave ethically in *all* your courses, but that there are additional professional ethical standards that apply to *this* course.
4. Consult with your instructor if you have any uncertainty about the ethics of a work situation.
5. Understand that violations of professional ethics may lead to grade reduction, an F for the course, expulsion from the college, and/or civil and criminal penalties.
