# Create a LinkedIn Profile

LinkedIn is a social networking site with a focus on professional development, job hunting, and career advancement. At LinkedIn, you "connect" with other users to make them part of your professional network.

1. If you do not already have one, create an account and a profile at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com).
2. Add an item to the "Experience" section of your profile.
  Title: Trainee
  Company: DevOps (Davis & Elkins Volunteers Operating Production Systems) 
2. Connect with `mattinglys@dewv.edu`. Also consider connecting with your DevOps teammates, other past employers and coworkers, etc.
3. Update this folder's [`README.md`](./README.md) to check the activity as complete. (From now on, activity instructions will no longer remind you about this.)
