# Personal Leave Policy

In a professional work environment, it is unacceptable to simply fail to appear. 

If you must take a "personal leave" day away from work, notify your teammates by emailing `devops@dewv.edu`. 

Provide as much advance notice as possible, and work with teammates to cover any short term responsibilities that you will be unable to complete.
