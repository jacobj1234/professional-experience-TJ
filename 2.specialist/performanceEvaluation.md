# Performance Evaluation

Every two weeks, you will set goals for your own professional growth. 

Update the `performance/goals.md` file to include:
1. the date, formatted as a level 2 heading (for consistency, use the Monday of the relevant week)
2. two to four professional development goals that you will pursue in the next two weeks, and
3. when applicable, comments related to progress on past goals, obstacles you encountered, etc.

The goals may mention technical tools, but it is more important that they are written in organizational/professional development terms.
- Not good: "Learn MySQL"
- Good: "Learn to design and build relational database tables"
- Good: "Learn to design and build relational database tables using MySQL"
- Very good: "Design and build MySQL relational database tables for system X"

In addition to technical goals, try to include goals that develop and demonstrate [soft skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills) and [general organizational skills](./professionalDevelopmentCriteria.md).

This process serves several purposes. 
- It provides you with a high-level view of the professional experience and (hopefully) a sense of direction and progress.
- It provides managers with important information for assigning tasks.
- It provides opportunities for celebrating your achievements, and communicating them to future employers.

This information will become the basis for professional communications like LinkedIn updates and letters of recommendation, so write with that in mind. For specific guidance, you might search for descriptions of "Edited Standard Written English".

It is also good practice to write goals that meet [SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).
