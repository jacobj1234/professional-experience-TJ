# Customer Service communications process

At the start of each staff meeting, a designated person will:

1. Update the Customer Service commications project board by adding [all new customer-originated Issues](https://github.com/dewv/ops/projects/2?label=Customer+initiated&no=project).
2. Convene an ops discussion, with all staff, and record decisions/assignments. The group will discuss each item on the board and agree on its status (column), next steps, and next customer follow up.
