# Development Tasks

These tasks attempt to improve (change) the status quo of our operational systems and processes. They are under the control of individual project managers. IS Managers and IS Specialists coordinate task assignments using MS Teams under team DevOps, channel Staffing.

Post a "work wanted" message there when you need a task assignment. You may request to work on certain GitHub Issues, but there's no guarantee you'll get that assignment.

IS Managers monitor this discussion and respond to "work wanted" messages.

Tasks are officially assigned when a *Manager* records the Assignee on the GitHub Issue(s).
